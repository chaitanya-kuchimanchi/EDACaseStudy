# Project Name
> Lending loans to applicants with a higher risk of default is a significant financial loss for most lending companies, known as credit loss. The borrowers who default, also called 'charged-off' customers, cause the most significant losses to lenders. This case study aims to identify such risky loan applicants through EDA, leading to a reduction in credit loss.

In summary, the company seeks to determine the key factors or driver variables responsible for loan defaults. Understanding these factors would enable the company to assess portfolio and risk better.
